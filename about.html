	<h1>About the Author</h1>
	  <p>Hello my name is Alina. A junior in Information Technology and Informatics.I graduated from the Monmouth County Vocational School District’s Commercial Art Program in 2021. My passion for technology and design led me to explore a multitude of programs, transforming my initial curiosity into a lasting love for artistry and innovation. Exploring motion graphics in After Effects, crafting 3D objects with Blender, and designing graphics with Photoshop have brought me to this point, where I now seek to merge these skills with web design.</p>
	  <p>Aside from this, I enjoy using my skills in video and photo editing to create fun visuals with my interest in costuming and animation. Showcasing my work on platforms such as <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/hyakaera/" target = "_blank" class="link">Instagram</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@hyakaera" target = "_blank" class="link">YouTube</a>, and <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/@hyakaera?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc" target = "_blank" class="link">TikTok</a> where I’ve gained a large audience over the years. This has allowed me to cultivate my skills through self-directed learning and draw inspiration from the many creative voices in the digital landscape.</p>
  </br>
	  <p>Additional important note I love cats and appreciate photos of your furry friends (!!!emphasis on the furry part, I'm sorry naked cat owners they're not for me...) Please enjoy a few photos of my outdoors friends around campus</p>
