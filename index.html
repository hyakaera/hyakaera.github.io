         <p><blockquote>Waste never truly goes away. As technology advances and the production of items increases, so does the amount of waste it brings. It is an unintended consequence we face as humans who have created materials that are difficult to break down by nature. A portion of a book I read by Brian Thill discussed how consumerism is arguably the root cause of why we struggle so much today to keep the amount of waste and pollution down. As trends pop up, the production of those items increases, and large corporations tend to produce in terms of profitability rather than sustainability. In addition to that, there have unfortunately been little upgrades to how our waste is processed and thrown out; while some countries have fortunately tackled this issue through their own means, America has not appeared to make much progress in my own eyes as a university student here. Many people have turned a blind eye to the negative impact, and those with a large impact on pushing others to do better with it simply don’t care. <a href = "essay.html" class="link">Continue Reading Here...</a></blockquote>

         <h2>Overview: Let the Journey Begin!</h2>
	<hr>
         <p>As I was just starting out, I decided to start with some items I already knew had to go. They had been sitting around for months, and there were more items that piled up with them that I’ll record later on. After gathering my items, I actually noticed something that almost half of them had in common - the theme of stars. At first, I thought it was just the glow-in-the-dark stars, the stress toy, and my ice cube tray, but then I remembered the pony's name was <a href = "https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight_Sparkle" target = "_blank" class = "link">Twilight Sparkle</a>. I originally snapped the photo on the side that did not have her cutie mark on it (if you don’t know about My Little Pony, each pony has a talent that ends up being represented by a tattoo on their backside, which is called a <a href = "https://equestriagirls.fandom.com/wiki/Cutie_marks" target = "_blank" class = "link">cutie mark</a>). So after I realized that, I just had to go back and take another photo with it in there.

</p>
	<h3>Bad Memory <em>[coloring page, cards, star stress toy, glove]</em>
</h3>
	<p>These items are all connected to times when I had issues with people. Although I held onto these simply because they were given to me or previously had use, it reminds me of those times and I don’t need that negativity to plague me. To begin with, we have a coloring page that my partner did during a club event. I thought it was super funny because he was trying to make it look as bad as possible. He actually didn’t want me to keep it from the beginning so it is better that I toss it out. Next, the cards are from people I don’t like, theres images of animals on them but I would rather not share it. These were given to me during christmas and my birthday. Next a red star <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_ball" target = "_blank" class = "link">stress toy</a> was found under a couch in the building across from the Rutgers business building. I had been crying and when I went to move the seat to sit more comfortably I found this under it! It was comforting during it but again, its connected with the feelings so I decided to let go of it. Lastly there is the singular glove. It is <a href = "https://a.co/d/6P9B1hM" target = "_blank" class = "link">black, soft, and warm</a> (when they were new) I lost one of them during a walk and they were wearing down. It was during a particularly harsh week as well.
</p>
	<h3>Household Items <em>[ice cube tray, hair curler, lint]</em>
</h3>
	<p>Any household will typically have these items. Unless of course, you have an instant ice maker, someone with short hair, and don’t do your own laundry. I will argue though, that star ice cubes are so much better than normal ones. This one is blue and silicone but unfortunately, due to much use, there are holes in many of the molds. This was bought when I visited family in VietNam, originally to make a Vietnamese dessert called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar" target="_blank" class="link">thạch</a>. Next up, this <a href = "https://a.co/d/6c5VbyJ" target = "_blank" class = "link">pink hair curler</a> creates nice waves in your hair. It was gifted to me by my aunt, but I just find that using a normal hair straightener is easier to use. So it is in perfect condition, I decided to give it away to someone who would make use of it. Lastly there is some <a href = "https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Lint-from-a-Dryer" target = "_blank" class = "link">lint</a>, that my roommate had left in the laundry. Lint is a hazard if you don’t remove it before dryer use so I had to trash it! I know its not really a sentimental item but I included it anyways as a little extra.
</p>
	<h3>Childhood Items <em>[glow in the dark stars, pony]</em>
</h3>
	<p>Growing up, these may have been something you owned. Every child always wanted to go to bed with glow in the dark stars littering their walls, I am no different. The only issue was when your ceiling wasn’t compatible with the provided stickers that keep them up and they fell down! These stars do as they are called - glow, and even after many years, they still have the same green glow from when they were just bought. Although they are a good memory, they no longer fit in the aesthetic of my room; however, I know someone that wanted these on their room wall, so I gave them away. As for the pony, even to this day the series is extremely popular. This toy is actually my roommates. It features a purple horse, with pink and purple hair. She got it as a present from another one of our friends. The most memorable moment was when I thought the hair was sitting oddly so I tried to straighten it and burnt off some hair. It is being donated due to the fact that I am replacing it.

	<h2>Profile: Item of the Week</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>I have decided to nominate the My Little Pony plush as my item of the week. Why? I believe theres a funny story behind it. I vaguely mentioned earlier that this toy does not belong to me. I also told you the story about how I burnt its hair trying to make it look more presentable for my roommate. This pony has been through a lot, and although its still clean and in okay shape, I decided that my roommate deserves better. So I have decided that donating this and buying her a new pony would be the plan. After all, I did ruin her hair. For now, it has been replaced by my plushie that she absolutely despises. You may be wondering, why? Well, it’s an inside joke, she’ll find out after a few days but I’ll make her believe that my plushie is the replacement. 
</p>
	<p>The pony is made with a fleece material and the hair with synthetic plastic material. The embroidery of the stars is done by machine because there are likely hundreds produced with it. As with many items, it is manufactured in China, and the production was initiated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro" target="_blank" class="link">Hasbro</a>- the company that has the copyright to the series. In terms of culture, it had a massive impact on the fan space in the early 2010s, fans of the show made many fan animations, music, and more. One of the most infamous songs inspired by the show is <a href="https://youtu.be/lSE1Nv-ivdc?si=fgrKCO5AtqWHDkCx" target="_blank" class="link">“Discord”</a> by The Living Tombstone. As it is a childrens toy, the material is made generally safe, except for the hair due to its plastic material which will not break down easily.
  </p>
	
	<h3>Three Reasons Why I chose this Item</h3>
	
	<ol>
	<li>My roommate doesn't deserve it. (just kidding, but every time she sets 10 alarms in the morning when I have class it really brings me close to buying 50 of my plushies and shipping them to her house because I know her dad would be on my side and make her suffer with them) </li>
	<li>It's from a series I like and couldn't bare trashing something that could still be enjoyed by a child.</li>
	<li>It's such an underrated series that even as an adult I would watch all 100 something episodes all over again, who told them to make such good music? Have you ever heard of <a href = "https://youtu.be/UzsxfO7dBlA?si=iGTbeAhXm0LAaeUh" target="_blank" class="link">This Day Aria</a> because that is the best thing to ever exist.</li>

	<h2>Coda: Thank You</h2>
		<hr>
	<p>Thank you so much for joining me on this journey of being more conscious and getting over a bad habit, hopefully you continue to check back as I can find it in myself to get rid of some more difficult items of value. My goal overall is to finally have the ability to live a more minimalist life. Since I currently live with my parents and will eventually move out, I just don’t want to carry everything with me, so I think this will help a lot. Perhaps I will still be continuing this project during the move- out and the activity on this account will increase, who knows. Anyways, please consider signing up to receive updates and I’ll see you all next time!
