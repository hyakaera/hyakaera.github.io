         <h1>About</h1>
         <p>I graduated from the Monmouth County Vocational School District’s Commercial Art Program in 2021. My passion for technology and design led me to explore a multitude of programs, transforming my initial curiosity into a lasting love for artistry and innovation. Exploring motion graphics in After Effects, crafting 3D objects with Blender, and designing graphics with Photoshop have brought me to this point, where I now seek to merge these skills with web design.</p>
         <p>Aside from this, I enjoy using my skills in video and photo editing to create fun visuals with my interest in costuming and animation. Showcasing my work on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok where I’ve gained a large audience over the years. This has allowed me to cultivate my skills through self-directed learning and draw inspiration from the many creative voices in the digital landscape.</p>
