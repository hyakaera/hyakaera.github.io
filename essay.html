		<h3>Trash: in the Modern Day</h3>
		<p>Waste never truly goes away. As technology advances and the production of items increases, so does the amount of waste it brings. It is an unintended consequence we face as humans who have created materials that are difficult to break down by nature. A portion of a book I read by Brian Thill discussed how consumerism is arguably the root cause of why we struggle so much today to keep the amount of waste and pollution down. As trends pop up, the production of those items increases, and large corporations tend to produce in terms of profitability rather than sustainability. In addition to that, there have unfortunately been little upgrades to how our waste is processed and thrown out; while some countries have fortunately tackled this issue through their own means, America has not appeared to make much progress in my own eyes as a university student here. Many people have turned a blind eye to the negative impact, and those with a large impact on pushing others to do better with it simply don’t care.
Take a look at Japan for comparison, they have actively worked on their policies and technology for waste management systems as consumerism builds up their landfill. One such technology is their <a href="https://www.union.tokyo23-seisou.lg.jp.e.de.hp.transer.com/kojo/index.html" target="_blank"class="link"> incineration plants located in central Tokyo.</a> In an article called We Are Tomodachi the incineration plant process is as such:
“At the plant, the garbage is first mixed with a large crane so that all the different kinds and sizes of items are uniformly distributed for easier burning. Next, the waste is incinerated at extremely high temperatures, over 800°C (1,472°F). This reduces not only the volume to 1/20 of what it was but also the amount of dioxin gases produced by incineration. Multiple provisions are made to prevent gases and harmful substances emitted during incineration, such as sulfur oxide and particulate matter, from being emitted outside the facilities. Chimneys of waste incineration plants emit vapor—not smoke—that does not contain harmful substances. Heat energy produced by the incinerator is used to supply the electricity needs of the entire facility, with any remainder being sold (earning approximately JPY 9.8 billion annually, or USD78.6 million, in income from electricity). High-temperature water is also supplied to neighborhood swimming pools and tropical plant greenhouses”.
Their plant is not the only thing keeping their amount of waste down. Even <a href = “https://motto-jp.com/media/lifestyle/the-basics-of-sorting-your-trash/” target="_blank" class="link">their citizens play a role in the proper disposal of items</a> and do their due diligence to ensure their streets stay clean. Hopefully, one day, this technology will be more widespread overseas in high-population areas such as New York. Now, arguably, even after incineration, it creates a new form of waste: air pollution. Newman, an archeologist, mentions in an article interview that “The biggest myth about trash is simply that we talk about throwing things “away.” There is not, nor has there ever been, an “away” for things to go.” They simply change form and become more waste even if the government says it is more sustainable, there needs to be a way to prevent large amounts of items from becoming waste in the first place.

		<h3>Education and Awareness</h3>
		<p>After taking an environmental science course this recent fall semester, I have decided to be a little more conscious of how I dispose of items. I have found that I oftentimes get confused about where certain items should be sent. It is truly unfortunate that the school system does not strongly educate children on topics like trash and recycling when they are so crucial to maintaining the world we live in. While teachers share news articles and teach us about pollution, we are not taught what we can do to prevent it. Project Green Schools is an initiative started by Robin Buchanan, it aims to partner up with schools to help them educate their youth. It isn’t light to say that those of the younger generation are the future of this world; while the education system may have failed in earlier years, implementing a program such as this would ensure that the kids that grow up are more aware and will be able to change the world so that later generations won’t continuously break down our planet.
</p>
		<h3>My Initiative</h3>
		<p>I have a bad habit of hoarding unnecessary items, something I believe happened through the environment I grew up in. Recording what I throw out each week would keep me accountable for properly disposing of items and also help me declutter the items I own. I would be more self-aware of my own wastefulness, as I used to not give a second thought about throwing away perfectly useful items just to get them out of my sight. While I record my memories and the reasoning of how I disposed of them, hopefully, it helps educate others to be more thoughtful about throwing away their trash as well. I will be sharing photos of the item, maybe past memories of it, the disposal method, and any fun facts and research behind it.
It is truly unfortunate that I did not start this initiative sooner; however, I believe that my first step in being more aware of my trash, despite being just one person, can have an effect on others and push them also to try to be more kind to our environment—every little bit of contribution matters. There will probably be a lot of sentimental value to the items I throw out, especially later on after I’ve tossed out all the unneeded small items I’ve likely forgotten about in the bottom left corner of my closet. I am someone who keeps items, thinking I’ll have use for them later. I think being a crafter plays a large part in that since many art supplies keep for a long time, or a small amount of it goes a long way. Even items like scraps of paper, beads, buttons, and a piece of metal could one day become art. Vik Muniz is a contemporary artist who used waste to create two series of artworks. One of the series, <a href = “https://vikmuniz.net/gallery/garbage”  target="_blank"class="link">“Pictures of Garbage,”</a> was created using garbage from a landfill outside of Rio de Janeiro called Jardim Gramacho to create portraits of those who live and work in the area. It comes to say that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure is a very true statement. He brought out the best of what others thought no longer had use. I think that I just need to come to a realization that while items I have may have potential, they won’t reach its potential in my hands. I hope you all look forward to what will become of this page!
